# gray-matter [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/gray-matter.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/gray-matter)

> A simple to use and extend front matter library. Supports parsing and extracting YAML, JSON, TOML or Coffee Front-Matter, with options to set custom delimiters.

Used by [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble), [verb](https://github.com/assemble/verb), and many other projects!

## Highlights

* Reliable and battle-tested. 
* Will extract and parse:
  * [YAML](http://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml)
  * [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json)
  * [TOML](http://github.com/mojombo/toml)
  * [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) when `options.eval` is set to `true`
  * [CSON](https://github.com/bevry/cson) when `options.eval` is set to `true`
  * JavaScript: when `options.eval` is set to `true`
* Easy to add additional parsers! pull requests welcome!

## Install
## Install with [npm](npmjs.org)

```bash
npm i gray-matter --save
```
### Install with [bower](https://github.com/bower/bower)

```bash
bower install gray-matter --save-dev
```

## Usage

```js
var matter = require('gray-matter');
console.log(matter('---\ntitle: foo\n---\nbar');
//=> {data: {title: 'foo'}, content: 'bar', orig: '---\ntitle: foo\n---\nbar'}
```

## API



## Options
> All methods will accept an options object to be passed as a second parameter

## options.eval
Type: `Boolean`

Default: `false`

Evaluate coffee-script, CSON or JavaScript in front-matter. If you aren't aware of the dangers, google is your friend.

## options.lang
Type: `String`

Default: `yaml`

The parser to use on the extracted front matter. Valid options include:

* `yaml`
* `json`
* `coffee` 
* `cson` 
* `toml` 
* `js`|`javascript`

## options.delims
Type: `Object`

Default: `{delims: ['---', '---']}`

Open and close delimiters can be passed in as an array of strings. Example:

```js
matter.read('file.md', {delims: ['~~~', '~~~']});
```


## Examples

Let's say our page, `foo.html` contains

```html
---
title: YAML Front matter
description: This is a page
---
<h1>{{title}}</h1>
```

then running the following in the command line:

```js
console.log(matter('foo.html'));
```
returns

```json
{
  "data": {
    "title": "YAML Front matter",
    "description": "This is a page"
  },
  "content": "<h1>{{title}}</h1>",
  "original": "---\ntitle: YAML Front matter\n---\n<h1>{{title}}</h1>"
}
```
and

```js
console.log(matter('foo.html').data);
```
returns


```json
{"title": "YAML Front matter", "description": "This is a page"}
```


## Why?

> Why another YAML Front Matter library?

Because other libraries we tried failed to meet our requirements with [Assemble](http://assemble.io). Some most of the libraries met most of the requirements, but _none had all of them_. Here are the most important:

* Be usable, if not simple
* Allow custom delimiters
* Use a dependable and well-supported library for parsing YAML and other languages
* Don't fail when no content exists
* Don't fail when no front matter exists
* Have no problem reading YAML files directly
* Have no problem with complex content, including fenced code blocks that contain examples of YAML front matter. Other parsers fail on this.
* Should return an object that contains the parsed YAML front matter and content, as well as the "original" content.

## Changelog

**v0.6.0 breaking changes!**


**v0.5.0 breaking changes!**

* YAML is now parsed using the `.safeLoad()` method from [js-yaml](http://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml).
* To parse coffee, CSON or javascript front matter, you must set `options.eval` to true.
* `stringify()` has been renamed to `toJSON()`
* `stringifyYAML()` has been renamed to `toYAML()`
