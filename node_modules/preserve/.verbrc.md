Useful for protecting tokens, like templates in HTML, from being mutated when the string is transformed in some way, like from a formatter/beautifier.

For example, say you want to use [js-beautify] on this string of html: `<ul><li><%= name %></li></ul>`:

**Without `preserve`**

The variable is now unusable, and the formatting is wrong.

```html
<ul>
  <li>
    <%=n ame %>
  </li>
</ul>
```

**With `preserve`**

Correct.

```html
<ul>
  <li><%= name %></li>
</ul>
```

For the record, this is just a random example, I've had very few issues with js-beautify in general. But with or without js-beautify, this kind of token mangling does happen sometimes when you use formatters, beautifiers or similar tools.
